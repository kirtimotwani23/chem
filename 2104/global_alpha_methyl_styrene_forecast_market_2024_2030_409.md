</p><p>The growth trajectory is driven by increasing demand in end-user industries, notably the automotive and electronics sectors, which utilize AMS-based polymers and resins for lightweight, durable, and heat-resistant components.</p><p>
</p><p>Regionally, the <strong>North American AMS market</strong> is also on an upward trend, valued at <strong>USD 220 million in 2024</strong>, and expected to reach <strong>USD 340 million by 2032</strong>, growing at a <strong>CAGR of 5.6%</strong>. Factors such as the robust manufacturing infrastructure, technological advancements, and increasing consumer preference for high-performance plastics and adhesives contribute to this growth.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Alpha Methyl Styrene (AMS)</strong> is an organic compound with the chemical formula C9H10. It is a colorless liquid characterized by a sharp, aromatic odor and is classified as an intermediate in the chemical manufacturing sector. Primarily used as a co-monomer in the production of plastics and resins, AMS enhances thermal stability and impact resistance. It is synthesized during the dehydrogenation of cumene and also appears as a byproduct in the production of phenol and acetone. AMS plays a crucial role in various industries, including automotive, electronics, adhesives, and wax formulations.</p><p>
