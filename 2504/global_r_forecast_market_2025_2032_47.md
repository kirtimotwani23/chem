<h1>R290 (Propane) Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Propane (R290) is a hydrocarbon refrigerant widely used in various cooling applications, including refrigerators, freezers, and air conditioning systems. It is a colorless and odorless gas with the chemical formula CH3CH2CH3. R290 is an environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic refrigerants like hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) due to its low Global Warming Potential (GWP) and zero Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP).</p><p>
</p><p>The compound exhibits excellent thermodynamic properties, making it highly energy-efficient. Given its cost-effectiveness and performance advantages, R290 is increasingly adopted across industries despite safety concerns associated with its flammability.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
