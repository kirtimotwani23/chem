<h1>Dry Powder Inhalers Market, Global Outlook &amp; Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Dry Powder Inhalers (DPIs) are a type of inhalation device used to deliver medication directly to the lungs in the form of a dry powder. These devices are commonly used for the treatment of respiratory diseases such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis. Unlike metered-dose inhalers (MDIs), DPIs do not require a propellant and instead rely on the patient’s inhalation effort to disperse the medication.</p><p>
