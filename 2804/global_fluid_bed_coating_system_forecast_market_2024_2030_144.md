<h1>Fluid Bed and Coating System Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p><strong>The global Fluid Bed and Coating System market was valued at $7.2 billion USD in 2023 and is projected to reach $10.6 billion USD by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.8% during the forecast period. The influence of COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine War were considered while estimating market sizes.</strong></p><p>
</p><p>A fluidized bed occurs when a bunch of different solid particles is put through appropriate conditions to make the mixture act like a fluid. This procedure is conducted by forcing fluids, air, and pressurized gas through the bedded layer of solid particles. After this process, fluidization takes place as solid materials obtain the qualities found in normal fluid. The global fluid bed and coating system market is likely to observe growth with the rising demand of the product from the pharmaceutical industry. The fluid bed and coating system is utilized in the pharmaceutical businesses for the purpose of coating a wide range of pharmaceutical formulations and active pharmaceutical ingredients.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
