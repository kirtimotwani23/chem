<h1>High-purity Solid Potassium Hydroxide Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>High-purity solid potassium hydroxide (KOH), commonly known as caustic potash, is a strong inorganic base with a chemical formula of KOH. It is a white, highly soluble solid that absorbs moisture from the air and reacts with carbon dioxide to form potassium carbonate. The high-purity variant is essential in industries such as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and electroplating due to its strong alkaline properties. This substance is widely utilized in the production of liquid soap, biodiesel, alkaline batteries, and as a pH regulator in various applications.</p><p>
