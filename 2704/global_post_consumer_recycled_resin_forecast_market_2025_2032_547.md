<h1>Post Consumer Recycled Resin Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Post-consumer resin (PCR) refers to plastic materials that have been reclaimed and reprocessed from consumer and industrial packaging waste. These materials include plastic films, bottles, milk jugs, buckets, and industrial packaging such as IBC totes and poly drums. Once collected, these plastics undergo sorting, cleaning, and processing to be repurposed into new plastic products, contributing to sustainability efforts and reducing environmental waste.</p><p>
