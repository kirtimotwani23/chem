Degradable Chelators are environmentally friendly complexing agents that break down naturally in the environment, used in various applications including cleaning products, water treatment, and personal care to replace traditional, persistent chelators.</p><p>
China's Degradable Chelator market is growing rapidly, driven by stringent environmental regulations, increasing consumer awareness, and industrial shift towards sustainable chemistry. In 2023, China produced approximately 65,000 metric tons of degradable chelators, encompassing various types such as GLDA, MGDA, EDDS, and IDS. The cleaning and detergent sector remains the largest consumer, accounting for 45% of demand, followed by water treatment at 25%, personal care at 15%, and industrial applications at 15%. The market saw a significant boost from China's ban on phosphates in detergents, leading to a 40% increase in degradable chelator adoption in laundry and dishwashing products in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on developing new, more efficient chelators, with recent innovations offering 30% better performance and 25% lower production costs compared to 2020 standards. The market is seeing strong growth in water treatment applications, increasing at 15% annually, driven by the chelators' effectiveness in scale inhibition and metal removal. In 2023, new regulations on industrial wastewater treatment led to a 35% increase in the use of degradable chelators in textile and paper industries. The industry faces challenges from higher costs compared to traditional chelators, but ongoing research and economies of scale are gradually narrowing this gap. Emerging applications in agriculture are showing promise, with degradable chelators for micronutrient delivery and soil remediation growing at 20% CAGR, albeit from a small base of 5% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from China's push towards a circular economy, with degradable chelators for recycling and resource recovery applications projected to grow at 12% CAGR through 2030.</p><p>
