<h1>Pseudo Boehmite Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2024-2030</h1><p>The global <strong>pseudo boehmite market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 294.55 million in 2023 to USD 443.33 million by 2030</strong>, expanding at a <strong>CAGR of 6.1%</strong> during the forecast period, according to industry analysts. This steady growth trajectory reflects rising demand across key industrial applications including petrochemical catalysts, ceramics, and specialty coatings.</p><p><strong>1. Expanding Petrochemical Sector:</strong><br>
With the global petrochemical market expected to reach <strong>$1 trillion by 2030</strong>, pseudo boehmite is witnessing unprecedented demand as a catalyst carrier material. Its unique pore structure and thermal stability make it ideal for fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) processes, with major refiners increasing adoption by <strong>7-9% annually</strong>.</p><p><strong>2. Advancements in Ceramic Technologies:</strong><br>
The ceramics industry now accounts for <strong>32% of pseudo boehmite consumption</strong>, driven by its ability to enhance material strength and thermal shock resistance. Manufacturers are particularly focusing on developing low-sodium variants (
