With middle-class households projected to reach <strong>36 million by 2030</strong>, consumers are allocating 22-25% of home improvement budgets to premium flooring.

Technological Advancements:</strong><br>
Digital printing innovations have enhanced design realism by <strong>65%</strong>, while improved installation systems achieve <strong>98.2% success rates</strong> across Vietnam's network of 2,350 certified installers.

    Fluctuations in PVC resin prices â accounting for <strong>35-40% of production costs</strong> â create margin pressures, forcing manufacturers to revise pricing quarterly. Recent supply chain disruptions have compounded these challenges.</p><p><strong>Installation Quality Concerns:</strong><br>
    While certified installers maintain high standards, the rapid market expansion has led to <strong>12-15% subpar installations</strong> by uncertified contractors, potentially damaging product reputation and requiring increased consumer education efforts.</p><p><strong>Competition from Traditional Materials:</strong><br>
