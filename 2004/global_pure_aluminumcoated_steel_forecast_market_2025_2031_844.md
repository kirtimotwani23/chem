</p><p>Aluminized steel refers to steel that has undergone a hot-dip coating process with an aluminum-silicon alloy on both sides. This coating forms a strong metallurgical bond with the base steel, resulting in a hybrid material that combines the strength of steel with the corrosion resistance and thermal protection of aluminum. This makes it an ideal material for environments exposed to high temperatures and oxidation.</p><p>
