It can also be used to repair the insulation on wires or to bundle them together, to protect wires or small parts from minor abrasion, and to create cable entry seals, offering environmental sealing protection. Heatshrink tubing is ordinarily made of polyolefin, which shrinks radially (but not longitudinally) when heated, to between onehalf and onesixth of its diameter.</p><p>
