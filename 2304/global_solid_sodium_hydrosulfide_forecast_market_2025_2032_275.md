<h1>Solid Sodium Hydrosulfide Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2032</h1><p>Solid sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) is an inorganic compound primarily used in various industrial applications. It appears as an orange or yellow solid that is highly deliquescent, meaning it absorbs moisture from the air. Upon reaching its melting point, NaHS decomposes, releasing hydrogen sulfide gas. This compound is easily soluble in water and alcohol, making it versatile for numerous chemical and industrial uses.</p><p>
</p><p>Solid sodium hydrosulfide is a crucial chemical in several industries, including dye manufacturing, leather processing, wastewater treatment, mining, and artificial fiber production. It serves as a raw material in the synthesis of ammonium sulfide and pesticide ethanethiol intermediates. Given its chemical properties, it is also employed as an auxiliary agent for sulfide dye production.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
