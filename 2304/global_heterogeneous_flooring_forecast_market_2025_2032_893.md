</p><p>The upward trend is further supported by strong investments in infrastructure development, urbanization in emerging economies, and the expanding use of heterogeneous flooring in healthcare and education sectors due to its hygienic and durable nature.</p><p>
</p><p>Heterogeneous flooring refers to a versatile and multi-layered resilient flooring solution designed for both aesthetic appeal and functional performance. Unlike homogeneous flooring, which is uniform throughout, heterogeneous flooring is composed of distinct layers, each serving a specific purpose. These typically include a durable wear layer, a high-resolution printed design layer, and a stabilizing backing layer. This configuration provides superior wear resistance, enhanced visual effects, and structural integrity, making it suitable for high-traffic environments like hospitals, schools, commercial offices, and residential buildings.</p><p>
</p><p>The wear layer ensures protection against abrasion, stains, and heavy foot traffic, while the design layer offers a wide array of patterns and colors that can mimic wood, stone, ceramic, or abstract designs. The backing layer contributes to overall dimensional stability and underfoot comfort. In recent years, advancements in manufacturing technology have led to the development of heterogeneous flooring with improved sound insulation, antimicrobial properties, and ease of installation, further boosting its popularity across various sectors.</p><p>
