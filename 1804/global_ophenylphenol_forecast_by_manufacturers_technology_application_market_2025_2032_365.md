Particularly, the healthcare sector's post-pandemic emphasis on sanitation and hygiene has accelerated demand. The expansion of the textile and lithium-ion battery industries also significantly contributes to the compound's rising consumption. Innovations in chemical formulations that improve the efficacy and environmental compatibility of OPP-based products further enhance market prospects.</p><p>
</p><p>O-phenylphenol (OPP) is an organic compound that belongs to the phenylphenol family. It is primarily utilized as a disinfectant and preservative due to its antimicrobial properties. OPP appears as a white crystalline solid and is slightly soluble in water but highly soluble in organic solvents. In industrial contexts, it is widely used in surface disinfectants, especially in food processing facilities and healthcare settings. Furthermore, its effectiveness against a broad spectrum of microbial organisms makes it ideal for use in public sanitation and personal hygiene products.</p><p>
</p><p>Beyond its disinfectant role, o-phenylphenol serves as a crucial intermediate in the manufacture of various chemical products, including dyes, flame retardants, resins, and rubber additives. It also finds increasing application in the electronics sector, particularly in coatings and encapsulants due to its stability and resistance to heat. Moreover, its role in the production of lithium-ion batteries is gaining prominence, further diversifying its industrial importance.</p><p>
