</p><p>Historically, the market has experienced consistent demand from the textile and chemical manufacturing sectors, and emerging economies in Asia-Pacific are driving additional growth due to industrial expansion and urbanization. In particular, China accounts for approximately <strong>80% of the global market share</strong>, underscoring its dominance in both production and consumption.</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Para-dichlorobenzene (PDCB)</strong>, also known as 1,4-dichlorobenzene, is a white crystalline solid with a strong, pungent odor. It is primarily used as a deodorant in urinal blocks and as a pesticide, especially in mothballs. PDCB is synthesized by the chlorination of benzene and is characterized by its chemical stability and volatility, making it suitable for applications requiring slow sublimation into the air. The compound is also used as an intermediate in the manufacture of other chemicals, including polyphenylene sulfide resins and various agrochemical and dye products. Due to its widespread availability and usage, especially in households and industrial cleaning products, PDCB carries health risks when misused, making regulation and awareness critical in its application.</p><p>
