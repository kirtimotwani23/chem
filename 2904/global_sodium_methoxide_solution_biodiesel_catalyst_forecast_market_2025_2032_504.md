Derived from vegetable oils or animal fats, biodiesel production involves a chemical process called transesterification, where sodium methoxide facilitates the conversion of triglycerides into fatty acid methyl esters (biodiesel) and glycerin. This compound’s high catalytic efficiency and compatibility with diverse feedstocks make it a cornerstone in the biodiesel manufacturing process.</p><p>
