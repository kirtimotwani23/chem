</p><p>The growth is driven by increasing demand for fire-resistant materials in residential and commercial construction. Historical data suggests that the global market experienced steady growth, owing to advancements in manufacturing technology and the adoption of stricter building codes.</p><p>
</p><p>Fire Rated Composite Sandwich Panels are a type of advanced construction material consisting of three layers: a low-density core sandwiched between two thin skin layers. These panels provide superior insulation, durability, and fire resistance, making them highly effective in construction projects for roofs, walls, and ceilings. Core materials typically include expanded polystyrene (EPS), polyurethane (PU), phenolic aldehyde, and mineral wool, each offering unique thermal and mechanical properties. Fire-rated panels are designed to meet stringent fire safety regulations, ensuring structural integrity under extreme conditions.<strong style="font-size:14px">Market Dynamics</strong></p><p>
