It has a typical core-shell structure in sub-micron size with the core being a rubber phase. Adding 5%-10% MBS resin to PVC can increase the product's impact strength by 4-15 times and improve weather resistance and processing fluidity.</p><p>
</p><p>MBS, or Methyl Methacrylate-Butadiene-Styrene, is an impact modifier used in PVC products to enhance impact strength and other properties. It acts as an interface bonding agent between PVC resin and rubber, improving product performance.</p><p>
