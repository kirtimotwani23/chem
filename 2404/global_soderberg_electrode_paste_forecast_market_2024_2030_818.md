Electrode paste was invented by Mr. Soderbergh. It is usually called Soderbergh electrode paste. The production process of electrode paste itself is relatively simple. Basically, it is calcined anthracite, calcined petroleum coke, residual anode, graphite powder, etc. Crushing, sieving and grinding, then mixing and heating in a certain proportion and kneading with coal tar pitch to form a carbon paste with good fluidity and high plasticity, and finally an electrode paste with a certain shape and size through natural molding. In the production of different types of ferroalloys and calcium carbide, it is self-baked into a conductor in a submerged arc furnace.</p><p>
