<h1>Flotation Depressant Market, Global Outlook and Forecast 2025-2031</h1><p>The global <strong>flotation depressant market</strong> is projected to grow from <strong>USD 180 million in 2024 to USD 226 million by 2031</strong>, registering a steady <strong>CAGR of 3.4% during 2025â2031</strong>, according to industry analysis. This expansion reflects the mining sector's need for specialized reagents that improve mineral separation efficiency amid declining ore grades and tighter environmental regulations.</p><p>Flotation depressantsâcritical chemicals in mineral processingâwork by selectively inhibiting unwanted minerals from attaching to air bubbles during flotation. Their ability to modify mineral surface properties makes them indispensable for producing high-purity metal concentrates, particularly for complex sulfide ores.</p><p><strong>1. Declining Ore Quality and Rising Processing Complexity:</strong><br>
As high-grade deposits dwindle worldwide, miners increasingly rely on depressants to economically process complex ores containing multiple metals. The industry reports <strong>23% more processing plants</strong> now handling polymetallic ores compared to 2020, necessitating advanced reagent solutions.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
