</p><p>The low-pressure injection molding process utilizes very low injection pressure to inject hot-melt adhesive material into the mold, solidifying it rapidly within 1-50 seconds. This process provides excellent sealing properties and physical features, delivering insulation, temperature resistance, impact resistance, shock absorption, moisture-proof, waterproof, dust-proof, and chemical corrosion resistance.</p><p>
</p><p>Low pressure molding hot melt adhesive is a packaging process that involves injecting hot-melt adhesive material into molds under very low pressure, resulting in rapid solidification and excellent sealing properties. This method is primarily used for packaging and protecting sensitive electronic components such as printed circuit boards, automotive electronics, mobile phone batteries, and sensors, among others, offering significant advantages over traditional injection molding processes.</p><p>
