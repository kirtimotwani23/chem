</p><p>Agriculture Sprayer Tyres are specialized tires designed for use on crop spraying equipment, offering a combination of high load capacity, minimal soil compaction, and excellent stability to support efficient and precise application of fertilizers and crop protection products.</p><p>
</p><p>The global Agriculture Sprayer Tyres market is growing steadily, driven by increasing adoption of precision farming techniques, rising demand for crop protection products, and advancements in sprayer technology. In 2023, global production of agriculture sprayer tyres reached approximately 1.2 million units, with North America and Europe accounting for 65% of demand. Self-propelled sprayers remain the largest segment, representing 70% of demand, followed by trailed sprayers at 25%. The market benefited from the growing trend towards larger sprayers with higher capacities, leading to a 12% increase in demand for high-flotation sprayer tires in 2023. Technological advancements have focused on improving flotation, reducing soil compaction, and enhancing stability, with new tire designs offering up to 30% larger footprint and 25% better load distribution compared to 2020 models. The market is witnessing strong growth in VF (Very High Flexion) tires for sprayers, increasing at 8% annually, driven by their ability to carry heavier loads at lower inflation pressures, thus minimizing soil compaction. In 2023, the push towards precision agriculture led to a 20% increase in the adoption of sprayer tires compatible with central tire inflation systems for optimal performance across various field conditions. The industry faces challenges from the seasonal nature of spraying operations and the increasing popularity of drone-based spraying in certain crops, but the efficiency and coverage of ground-based sprayers continue to drive demand for high-performance tires. Emerging applications in autonomous sprayers are showing promise, with specialized tires designed for unmanned spraying operations growing at 15% CAGR, albeit from a small base of 2% market share. Looking ahead, the market is expected to benefit from innovations in tire compound technology, with new materials offering improved chemical resistance and longer service life projected to grow at 10% CAGR through 2030.</p><p>
