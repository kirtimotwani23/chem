</p><p>Shuttering oil, also known as formwork oil or mold release agent, is a specialized liquid applied to formwork surfaces before pouring concrete. Its primary function is to prevent concrete from adhering to molds, facilitating easy removal and ensuring a smooth finish. Shuttering oil enhances the longevity of formwork materials such as wood, metal, and plastic by reducing surface damage and wear. It is widely used in construction projects such as residential, commercial, and infrastructure developments, where high-quality concrete finishes are required.</p><div><b>Download FREE Sample of this Report @
